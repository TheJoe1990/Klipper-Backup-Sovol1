# Example: 3 hotends sharing 150 W, with Rapido V2 derating
[heater_power_distributor hotends]
heaters: extruder, extruder1, extruder2
max_power: 150                # total budget for the group (watts)
powers: 60, 60, 40            # rated W per heater, defaults to 60
#model: rapido_v2              # none|bambulab|v1|rapido_v2|v3|triangle70|custom, defaults to none
active_extruder_boost: 1.8    # multiply weight of active tool (1.0 = equal-share), defaults to 1
poll_interval: 1.0            # seconds between updates, defaults to 1
safe_distribution: true       # set false to start heaters from 100 and ramp down by the distributor
sync_mpc_power: false         # <i>(kalico mpc_control only)</i> set true to tell MPC its temp-derated available watts each tick to get better control across a wide temp band (may require recalibration of MPC)
